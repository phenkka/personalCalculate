This is your personal calculator assistant ByeByeMoney, which can record your dates.

There is one rule, however, the calculator can be used by a person with the name Egor.

The personal assistant can record your expenses, calculate the total amount of all expenses, filter by categories, etc.

I hope everyone will fulfill the first rule, otherwise we will have to make a private repo and give access after full identity verification.
